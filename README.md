# mxnet-docs

This repo contains the working draft for an overhaul of the _MXNet_ documentation. 

## Format guide
* All documents under the _Getting Started_, _FAQ_, and _Community_ tabs in the Nav should be written as markdown (.md) files. 
* All tutorials should be written as jupyter notebooks and subsequently compiled to markdown.
* Each tutorial (in the web docs) should link to both the Jupyter notebook and to a clean runnable version (.py).
* Each tutorial should be self-contained - including any code necessary to grab data sets.

## Style guide
To ensure a consistent, high quality reading experience, we impose the following style guidelines:
* No gratuitous capitalization, (that means no "Deep Learning" or "Neural Network"), even to introduce acronyms: go with "convolutional neural network (CNN)".
* Always use an Oxford comma to end lists: "A, B, and C".
* Lines in bulleted lists should end with periods.
